## Microbial Genetic Algorithm
The Microbial Genetic Algorithm (MGA) uses fight and infection strategy. Each time the MGA randomly selects the two in the population and fight, selects the winner and the loser, and infects part of the winner's genes to the loser, and both Complete an evolution and returning population.

## Group Microbial Genetic Algorithm
The Group Microbial Genetic Algorithm (GMGA) uses fight and infection strategy but not randomly. Divide the population into two groups, each time the GMGA selects each one in each group and fight, selects the winner and the loser, and infects part of the winner's genes to the loser, and both Complete an evolution and returning population.
